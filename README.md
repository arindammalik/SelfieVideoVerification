# Verification of user on social media platform

## Problem üåç 
With benefits of social media we also face drawback of it on daily basis. We are more prone to fall victim to spam users today than ever before. Spam user can use fake photos of someone else to fool people. 

## Solution
For this I designed simple online video verification back in 2019 and am sharing it. We can prevent spam user by asking people to verify themselves against the photo they have uploaded. In verification phase we capture real-time video of user and focus on detecting whether video is genuine and the person in the video matches the person of which photos are uploaded in the account. 

The project in divided into 4 phase:
1. Video capture
2. Asking user to blink to detect motion in the video
3. Verifying motion in video
4. Matching user in video with pictures uploaded
